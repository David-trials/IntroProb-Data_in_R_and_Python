# IntroProb-Data_in_R_and_Python

This repository contains some of the computational assignments solved by me from the course
Introduction to Probability and Data with R, on Coursera by Duke University.

The programming assignments were done in R language through the Rstudio environment.
I also add a corresponding file to each programming assignment but using Python to answer the same questions. 
This makes use of the popular Python libraries, Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib, for the data management and plots. 


Happy learning and visit the full course at coursera.org
